## Description & details

![Thumbnail Scool app image](/images/projects/scool.jpg){.rounded-lg.outline.outline-secondary-500}

App created for national app competition, which centers around schooling online. It's made with Flutter & Firebase, and it includes many features modern apps usually use: file storage, chatting, authentication

A team of 3 high school friends (including me) made this app from the ground up: from design and branding all the way to functionalities integrations. The app is very adaptable and contains primarily user-generated content. It has two types of accounts, for teachers and students. Teachers can create classrooms and upload study materials/assignments for their students. Students can enter the classroom either by typing classroom code manually or by scanning a QR code.

All classrooms have different color palettes generated based on the color teacher selected when creating that class.
And, of course, teachers can track and grade students' work (which are attached files they uploaded) and chat with them.

## Solved problems

::list
- Using Dart & Flutter to make them sync with everything in Firestore
- Creating dynamic environment for each classroom
- Uploading files simultaneously, storing them, and saving their reference in database
