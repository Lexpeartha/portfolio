# [Resetopia]{.highlight} - idle city builder

Venture into Resetopia, a city builder/idle game fusion where strategic resource management and building leads to passive income generation. Built for [Godot Wild Jam #78](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-78/rate/3334514) to answer the theme `Erase` (erasing map resource to build a city on top of it), this 3D game features an [RTS]{title="Real-Time Strategy"}-style camera system, building synergies and a reset mechanic that adds replayability.

## Technologies used

## Description & details

This game jam project was built with [Godot 4.4]{.highlight} and [GDScript]{.highlight}, marking my transition to Godot 4 and deeper exploration of 3D game development. Created for [Godot Wild Jam #78]{.highlight} (created in 9 days), the game challenges players to build a prosperous town while managing limited land and resources.

The core gameplay revolves around strategic decision-making: every forest you clear and building you construct opens new possibilities while closing others. Natural resources like woods and rocks must be removed to get resources and construct buildings, but the limited land means each choice matters. Some buildings synergize with the landscape and structures, creating opportunities for strategic thinking.

The game features an [RTS-style camera system]{.highlight} that allows players to navigate the 3D world intuitively using WASD controls, mouse-based tile selection, and smooth zoom functionality. The upgrade system lets players improve their buildings over time, while the mysterious purple crystal hints at Resetopia's secret: a reset mechanic.
