# Welcome to my [personal website]{.highlight}

Hi, I'm [Aleksa]{.highlight} [(_pronounced as `/ahlEHk-sah/`_ :LazyPronounceButton{audioSrc="/pronunciation.mp3"})]{class="text-sm"}<br />
a software engineering student based in [Serbia]{.highlight}. I like to build things, solve problems and dabble in various technologies. I'm huge believer in OSS and values it stands for, and my work is mostly related to [web development]{.highlight}, but I also like to explore different fields like systems engineering, mobile development, AI/ML and DevOps. In my free time I like to read books, play games and hang out with my friends.
