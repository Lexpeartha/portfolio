# Welcome to [my portfolio]{.highlight}

Hi, I'm [Aleksa]{.highlight} [(_pronounced as `/ahlEHk-sah/`_ :PronounceButton{audioSrc="/pronunciation.mp3"})]{class="text-sm"}<br />
a software engineer based in [Serbia]{.highlight}. I specialize in building scalable applications with [JavaScript]{.highlight}, working daily with [AI]{title="Artificial Intelligence"}/[LLMs]{title="Large Language Models"}, knowledge graphs and semantic web technologies to build trustworthy and verifiable agents.

I'm passionate about continuous learning and innovation in the tech world. Beyond my full-time work, I contribute to [OSS]{title="Open Source Software"}, build side projects, and stay up to date through hands-on experimentation, reading, and research.
