# Welcome to my [personal website]{class="text-secondary-600 dark:text-secondary-500"}

Hi, I'm [Aleksa]{class="text-secondary-600 dark:text-secondary-500"} [(*pronounced as* :PronounceButton{audioSrc="/pronunciation.mp3" class="inline-block"})]{class="text-sm"}<br />
a software engineering student based in [Serbia]{class="text-secondary-600 dark:text-secondary-500"}. I like to build things, solve problems and dabble in various technologies. I'm huge believer in OSS and values it stands for, and in my free time I like to read books, play indie games and hang out with my friends. My work is mostly related to [web development]{class="text-secondary-600 dark:text-secondary-500"}, but I also like to explore different fields like systems engineering, mobile development, AI/ML and DevOps.
